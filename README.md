# estike

A simple accounting app.

Written entirely in Flutter, working and tested on Android, Windows and Linux.

For running on Linux, the `libsqlite3-dev` package is needed.
For building on Linux, I had to install `libstdc++-14-dev`
(even though the documentation says `libstdc++-12-dev`).
Try newer versions if that does not work.
